# There's Waldo!

This project uses the template provided by Nick Arner (narner) on GitHub as a template for a computer vision iOS app.
The original template used can be found at <https://github.com/roboflow/roboflow-ios-starter>. Note that some major changes have
been made to the app, and it uses a completely different computer vision model.
